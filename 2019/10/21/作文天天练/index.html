In addition, we have prepared elaborate presents for each professor and teacher to express our sincere gratitude.

<p>As is vividly depicted in the cartoon, a student, with hesitation and worries, is making his decision to choose courses. The courses on the left are those contain advanced knowledge and demand personal creativity, of course, with much difficulties to pass. With little homework that is prone to get higher grades, the subjects on the right are totally different. Below the drawing, there is a caption, which says ‚ÄúChoosing courses‚Äù.<br><br>The purpose of the portrayal is to show us that we should make our mind to overcome the problems rather than escaping from the difficulties, so that we are bound to lead a meaningful life and get a sense of fulfillment. In fact, just as an old saying goes ‚ÄúChallenges are also chances‚Äù. It is these predicaments, which are seemingly insurmountable and impossible, that enables us to enrich our theoretical and practical knowledge, and to be experienced when we are confronted with similar situations in latter life. Therefore, once when it comes to such choices, we ought to choose the one that is more arduous and more challenging with no hesitation.<br><br>As far as I am concerned, it is of utmost significance for young people to possess the striving heart in the face of the hard nut. Only in this way can we build up our mental strength and pioneer a promising future.</p>

<p>Dear professor Cook,<br>&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp; We are extremely honored to invite you as one of the professors of our university.

In addition, the Palace Museum, also renowned as the Forbidden City, is another famous and wonderful scenic spot, which is worthy of your visit. It is the palace that is also the largest piece of ancient China‚Äôs architecture currently existing.<br>&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp; Maybe you have the opportunity to pay a visit to one or both of these attractions.

<p>As is vividly depicted in the cartoon, lying comfortably and leisurely on a chair, a young man says ‚ÄúI have so many books‚Äù in the face of a bookshelf, which is full of numerous books. On the contrary, another young man is sitting at his desk, with just several books on it, and he makes his mind to finish reading 20 books this year. Below the drawing, there is a caption, which says ‚ÄúPossessing books and reading books‚Äù.<br><br>We can deduce from the portrayal that the cartoonist tries conveying such a message: Actions speak louder than words. Undoubtedly, students should set their own goals, with an aggressive and striving heart. However, just talking is of absolutely no use, while it is your persistence and perseverance, toward you goals in general, that plays a crucial role in determining whether you can realize your dreams or not, rather than just imagining your future with no actions. Specifically, take us as an example, attaining satisfactory grades in the entrance exam, which is the very dream of us. Whereas, you could never make it come true without constant efforts and keeping making progress.<br><br>It is my view that actions is to words what reality is to ideality. Only when we put sufficient emphasis on what we have done rather what we have said can we pave the way to a promising future.</p>

Undoubtedly, the Internet is currently one of the most efficient media in personal communication. As a college student, I get on line every day to browse news, to study English by registering for online courses, and to chat freely with my friends. Meanwhile, some citizens admit that they are too addicted to the Internet to maintain face-to-face contact with their friends.

<p>As is vividly depicted in the cartoon, when students are about to graduate, it can be a tough choice for graduates to choose what to do in their latter life. Among the various choices, some students are getting ready to find a job, or pursuing a master degree, while others are going to study overseas and run their own business. Below the drawing, there is a caption which says ‚ÄúChoice‚Äù.<br><br>Undoubtedly, in the face of such numerous roads, students can be certainly hesitant and confused, yet they must take it seriously. First and foremost, it is the personal preference, which may vary from person to person, that plays a crucial role in determining whether students can make their favorable decisions or not, so as to lead a promising career in future. Moreover, it is of utmost significance for students to take their financial status into consideration, for some students can afford the expense of studying abroad, while it could be a heavy strain for others. Therefore, before making your mind, please take these factors into account, which will definitely benefit you in deciding what you would like to do.<br><br>To sum up, only when students deal with the correlation in these elements well can they make a much more satisfactory choice and pave the way to a promising occupation.</p>

<p>Dear Mr. President,<br>&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp; The past several years have witnessed the decreasing of students‚Äô physical fitness. As a college student of our university, I am writing the letter to present some of my suggestions about handling the problem.<br>&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp; To begin with, it is of utmost significance for students to enhance their awareness of the importance of physical exercise. Hardly can students build up their body strength when they realize the fact that they must take exercise to keep healthy. In addition, we would be grateful that if you could improve the quality of the hardware facilities in our school.<br>&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp; Your help is beyond my words. Thanks for your time and consideration.<br>&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;Yours Sincerely,<br>&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;Li Ming</p>

<p>As is vividly depicted in the cartoons, with holding her daughter‚Äôs hands firmly, the young lady is beautiful and charming in the left picture, which was taken thirty years ago. Now, the grown up daughter is supporting her mother in the right photo, with sweet smiles on their faces. Below the drawing, there is a caption which says ‚ÄùSupporting each other‚Äù.<br><br>Undoubtedly, we can deduce from the portrayal that the cartoonist tries conveying such a message: It is of utmost significance for us to provide financial support to our parents when they are too old to take care of themselves. Moreover, it is no exaggeration to say that, without the parents‚Äô loving care and selfless devotion we could never grow up healthily and achieve what we have got. It is the time when they are no longer young that we should take the responsibility of supporting and looking after them, which is the real meaning of love.<br><br>Admittedly, as a nation renowned worldwide for many of its virtues, the Chinese people have been always practicing the filial piety throughout the history. Respecting and loving our parents are just fundamental moral codes that, not only should we keep in mind, but we ought to put the codes into practice. Only in this way can we be worthy of the name of a Chinese.</p>

<p>As is vividly depicted in the cartoon, sitting at the stair with his heavy bag, the man on the right complains that he is too tired to keep climbing.

Moreover, it is no exaggeration to say that, without the constant efforts and keeping making progress, we could never achieve our goals. Take us as an example. Harvesting the satisfactory grades in the entrance exam, which is the very dream of us, however, some students persist all the year round while others give up.<br><br>Admittedly, perseverance is to goals what reality is to ideality, only when we undergo the toil and dilemmas with the persistent and striving heart can we pave the way to a promising and fruitful future.</p>
